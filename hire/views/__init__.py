# hire/views/__init__.py

# This file will import views specific to managing hire bookings.
# As views for creating, updating, or listing hire bookings (the bookings themselves, not the motorcycles)
# are developed or moved, they will be imported here.

# Example:
# from .bookings import (
#     HireBookingCreateView,
#     HireBookingDetailView,
#     HireBookingListView,
# )

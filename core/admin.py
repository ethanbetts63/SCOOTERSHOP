# core/admin.py

# This file is intentionally left empty as
# admin registrations for models originally in core/models.py
# have been moved to the admin.py files of their
# respective apps (dashboard, inventory, service, users).

# from django.contrib import admin

# If core gets new models in the future that need admin registration,
# register them here.
